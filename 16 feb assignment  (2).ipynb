    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use tables to organize data. \n",
    "They have a fixed schema, which means that the data is organized in a predefined structure, and any changes\n",
    "to the schema require altering the table structure. SQL databases use SQL as the primary language for \n",
    "managing and querying data. They are best suited for structured data with complex relationships and transactions, \n",
    "such as financial transactions and inventory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, do not use tables and have a dynamic schema,\n",
    "which allows for more flexibility in managing unstructured and semi-structured data. \n",
    "NoSQL databases are often distributed, meaning that data is stored on multiple servers, \n",
    "which allows for scaling to handle large amounts of data and high traffic. NoSQL databases \n",
    "use a variety of languages and interfaces for managing data, depending on the specific type of database.\n",
    "They are best suited for handling large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data,\n",
    "such as social media data and web analytics."
